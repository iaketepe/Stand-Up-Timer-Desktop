# Stand Up Timer Desktop

[Download - v1.0.0](https://github.com/iaketepe/Stand-Up-Timer-Desktop/releases/download/v1.0.0/Stand.Up.Timer.zip)

Stand Up Desktop is the desktop version of my web extension, ['Stand-Up-Timer'](https://github.com/iaketepe/Stand-Up-Timer). It's a timer that helps people stand up regularly after sitting for long periods of time. Since manifest three doesn't make it easy to have a background worker for sound effects, I created this version, relying on threads as solution to the original.
